[sample output with all functions and callbacks](https://basdon.github.io/documented-samp-pawn-api/main.xml) (this might be heavy to load)  
[all npc functions](https://basdon.github.io/documented-samp-pawn-api/npc.xml)

These are the default (0.3.7-R2-1-1) SA:MP PAWN include files but with documentation comments added. The documentation has been sourced from the (now defunct) SA:MP wiki, and has been somewhat amended/expanded.

Also includes missing native declarations for: `GetGravity`/`gpci`/`IsValidVehicle`

### howto

If you use these for your project, you can use the `-rfilename` PAWN compiler option to generate a report of your code in XML format and the report will include all referenced functions with their documentation.

This report will not show fully correctly unless [pawndocimproved](https://github.com/yugecin/pawndocimproved) is used.

For more information on this report and documentation syntax, see the PAWN language guide page 52: _A tutorial introduction - Documentation comments_.
